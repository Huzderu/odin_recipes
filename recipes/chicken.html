        <li>500g / 1 lb chicken breast</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>60g flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tbsp (50g) unsalted butter</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the breasts in half horizontally to create 4 steaks in total. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat - hold back about 1 tsp for later.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes until golden. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Turn heat down slightly to medium high.</li>
        <li>Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter. Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.</li>
        <li>Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir / shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of water and stir.</li>
        <li>Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over remaining sauce.</li>
    </ol>
